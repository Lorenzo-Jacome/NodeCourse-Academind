## File Description
### Sections 1 & 2
Simple and small codes that works as introduction to NodeJS
### Section 3 - Understanding the basics
Mountining a basic server just using NodeJS, handle basic requestes, responses, redirects, handle a response and write it using the file system, headers, writing some html into a page and modules in JS.
### Section 4 - Improved Development Workflow and Debugging
Learn the use of NPM, adding NPM scripts, identifying different error types, debugging with VSode and node
* `npm init` - Initalize node project / add extra features
* `npm start` - Runs script but its a special case (you don't need to write the run part) 
* `npm run nombre-script` - Run script created by user
* `npm install nombre-paquete` - Install packages from NPM into your project
  * `npm install nombre-paquete --save-dev` - You specify that the package will only be used in development, not production. Installs only for your project
  * `npm install nombre-paquete -g` - Installs the package globaly, not just for the project
  * `npm install` - Goes through your package json and installs and updates dependencies
#### Dependencies in this project:
* `npm install nodemon` - Package that removes the need to have to stop and run the programm again once changes are made and saved. Autorestarts server.
